    <h1>Front-end developer mentorship</h1>

    <h2>Why having a mentor is important?</h2>

    <p>Becoming a self-taught developer is never easy. There are courses like Codeacademy, bootcamps like HackReactor, books, video tutorials and everything in between. It's an information overload and it can be hard to navigate this landscape on your own. As a front-end developer mentor for the last 3 years, I've learnt that every student can benefit from a mentor no matter what kind of learning style they take. The problem is, is that every student learns differently, so no single course can teach everyone. Mentors apply the human touch to the process to make sure that information sticks.</p>

    <h2>What you will get from mentorship</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A one hour call every week for 4 weeks. Including pair programming and tailored to your needs</li>
      <li>Homework marked and set every week</li>
      <li>A reading list of resources curated for your level</li>
      <li>A private slack for you to contact me privately when you need an answer to a question</li>
      <li>Advice for interviews for full-time or freelance jobs</li>
      <li>Advice for working remotely</li>
      <li>Provide you with learning accountability (How many of you have tried and failed to learn from just free resources?)</li>
      <li>Help you to avoid the common pitfalls of learning to program</li>
      <li>Coach you to think like a programmer (It's hard if you've never coded before)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experience and technical expertise</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>7 years of coding experience</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>Javascript (including ES6 and beyond)</li>
      <li>React</li>

      <li>Node</li>
      <li>Dapp development (Ethereum)</li>
      <li>Git and Version Control</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have been coding since 2010, with experience as a mentor working at <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a>, since 2014. I have worked with dozens of students helping them change their jobs from marketers, office workers, Uber drivers to becoming full-time developers in almost every continent. I currently work as a remote freelance developer for agencies all over the world, whilst I live in Asia.</p>

    <h2>Cost</h2>

    <p>The price is $500 (USD) every 4 weeks, and will be paid in full before mentorship starts. Accepting payment via bank transfer, paypal or cryptocurrency (Ether/Bitcoin/Litecoin).</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>What is mentorship?</dt>
      <dd>Mentorship is similar to tutoring, but on top of tutoring you to become a better programmer, at the same time we are in the same industry and you can learn from my experience and mistakes. A tutor is teaching you a skill, whereas a mentor teaches you their craft.</dd>
      <dt>Why does mentorship cost money?</dt>
      <dd>A mentor is a kind of teacher, no one would expect a teacher to teach for free. This is a profession and good teaching deserves proper compensation, just as the skills I teach you will attract proper compensation</dd>
      <dt>Who is suitable for mentorship?</dt>
      <dd>Anyone that has a passion to learn to code and seriously wants to join the industry. On top of that self-drive is important as this is not a full-time class or course.</dd>
      <dt>Do I need to know programming before I can be mentored?</dt>
      <dd>I have experience teaching people with 0 programming experience and taking them to a level where they can be hired as a junior developer. I have also mentored students that have studied computer science and want to get into web development.</dd>
      <dt>How long is the mentorship?</dt>
      <dd>The mentorship periods will be for one month and can keep recurring until you or I decide that you no longer need my mentorship. I am always keeping up to date with the industry and hope to provide value wherever possible. I hope to bring to the level where I become obsolete.</dd>
      <dt>Why are you mentoring people?</dt>
      <dd>The best way to learn is to teach. I learn from my students everyday and it forces me to learn everything deeper to be able to explain things to someone without any experience. On top of that, I just like meeting new people and watching my students grow and change their lives.</dd>
      <dt>What makes you a good mentor?</dt>
      <dd>I learnt coding later in life in my 20s. I'm not a wunderkind who started programming on his commodore 64. And I did not study computer science. So if you're looking for someone that can break down the concepts that are so alien to the average human being, I've been through that process. You won't hear me use jargon and I love simple metaphors. It's a simple joy of teaching.</dd>
